Some details on the method: I fit 200 points without errors (but effectively assuming that the errors are smaller than the width of the stream, because I use an estimated width of the stream in comparing model vs. data) and the likelihood is just the best-fit orbit's likelihood for each trial potential (I don't marginalize over the orbit for each potential).
