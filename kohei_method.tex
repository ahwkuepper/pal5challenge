We use the variation of kinetic energy of stream particles along the stream, which can be interpreted as the variation of gravitational potential. We can determine the flattening of the potential if the kinetic energy does not monotonically increase or decrease along the stream.

I use 50 randomly selected stars (without error) from the leading or trailing streams. I assumed the correct parameters for disc and bulge potential as well as the correct scale length for the halo potential. I model the orbital energy distribution in each tail as a Gaussian distribution and run an emcee code to derive the posterior distribution of $(M/(10^{12}\msun), q_z)$.
