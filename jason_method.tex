Construct a model for a single stream by using information about the form of the stream in angle-frequency space in the true potential. The model favours two narrow clumps in frequency space aligned with the angle structure.

I attempted to fit the potential with the location of the progenitor known and no errors. I used only 30 stars. I fitted both a logarithmic potential (just two parameters circular velocity Vc and flattening q) and the full potential used for the simulation with all parameters bar the halo parameters held fixed.
