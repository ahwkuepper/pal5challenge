I use 4 stars randomly drawn from the tails of the simulated Pal 5 stream to fit for the halo parameters, with fixed bulge and disk parameters. This is a trivial test because I use the same potential to fit as the simulation was run in, I fix the disk and bulge, and I am using perfect data. Here is the marginal posterior over just the halo potential parameters (marginalizing over nuisance parameters I use to model the debris).
