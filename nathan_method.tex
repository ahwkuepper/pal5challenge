We model the stream as though it is generated by the orbit of a single particle in a fixed potential. We find the full PDF of a particular model using a Bayesian analysis. See \citet{Deg13} for a full description of the technique.

I used the full three-component model for the MW and fixed all model parameters except the halo mass and flattening. I also fit the progenitor's distance, radial velocity, and proper motion. I selected 100 random points from the sample with no error to constrain the model. Although there is no added error, the stream does have some thickness in all phase-space coordinates, which introduce 5 extra parameters that were fit as well.
