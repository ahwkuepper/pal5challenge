From present-day position \& velocity of the progenitor of interest, integrate the orbit of a cluster particle of a given mass in a test potential backwards for several Gyr. Then integrate forward to present time. While doing so, generate test stream particles. Compare the present-day distribution of stream test particles to the observations. Define likelihood, calculate likelihood, put in MCMC, stirr, ready.
